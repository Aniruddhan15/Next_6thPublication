# **Abstract: An Optimized Explainable Boosting Machine for Obesity Risk Prediction**

Obesity prediction is a critical challenge in preventive healthcare, requiring accurate and interpretable machine learning models to identify risk factors effectively. In this study, we leverage the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a powerful glass-box model that balances interpretability and predictive performance, to enhance obesity classification accuracy. We introduce an optimized pipeline incorporating feature engineering, class balancing, hyperparameter tuning, and scaling techniques to improve the modelâ€™s robustness and generalization.

Our methodology begins with one-hot encoding for categorical variables, ensuring that important non-numeric features contribute effectively to learning. We employ Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalances, leading to fairer and more reliable predictions across all obesity classes. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV optimizes key parameters, including learning rate, number of bins, and feature interactions, to fine-tune the model for maximum efficiency. Feature scaling is incorporated to standardize numerical inputs, reducing inconsistencies and improving convergence.

The EBM model is particularly advantageous over traditional machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Black-Box models (e.g., Neural Networks and XGBoost) due to its high interpretability and transparent decision-making process. Unlike deep learning models, which often function as "black boxes" with limited explainability, EBM provides human-readable insights into feature importance and interactions. This transparency is critical in medical and regulatory environments where model decisions must be interpretable and justifiable. Additionally, EBM leverages an additive boosting approach, making it less prone to overfitting while maintaining competitive accuracy levels comparable to ensemble models like XGBoost and Random Forests.

Through extensive experimentation, our optimized EBM model achieves higher accuracy and better generalization compared to baseline methods, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in healthcare analytics and obesity risk prediction. This study highlights the importance of combining interpretability with strong predictive performance, setting a benchmark for future research in explainable AI for medical applications.
